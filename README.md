#India Crop Production Data Analysis
India is an agricultural nation, with approximately 60% of its population engaged directly or indirectly in this sector. Agriculture contributes around 18% to the country’s total GDP.

##Motivation
With a population nearing 1.5 billion, I was intrigued by the question: Is India able to produce enough food to feed its people?
Since rainfall significantly affects crop yield, I’ve also incorporated rainfall data in this analysis.
